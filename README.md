# Fun with Machine Learning and GenAI

<hr style="border:2px solid red">

I am a result-oriented Product leader with combined Product Management and Engineering experience and a proven track record of addressing customer requirements by shipping multiple products at scale. I have taken numerous products from inception to shipping (0-1).

Shipped products in the following technical domains: Analytics Data Platform, Big Data Services, Observability, Real-time Big Data Storage, Query & Processing Systems, Streaming Applications, Web Services (JAX-RS REST APIs, OAuth2), Fintech Applications, Microservices, Multi-Tenant Cloud Services (hyperscalers), and Low Latency Systems

The repository includes some recent ML/AI projects I completed for fun

- [GenAI/HR-Resume-App](https://hub.docker.com/r/abhinav0/hr-resume-app) - A GenAI application that uses Google's Gemini LLM model to compare a resume with a job description and calculates the probability of passing a job screening system
- [ML/Predict the probability of an event](https://raw.githack.com/abhinav-profile/fun-with-ml-ai/main/hr.employee.quit.predict.1.1.0.html) - An ML model using supervised learning algorithms to predict the probability of an employee leaving a company
- [ML/Skills matrix](https://raw.githack.com/abhinav-profile/fun-with-ml-ai/main/hr.skills.matrix.1.1.0.html) - An ML model to generate a skills-based employee matrix
- [ML/Recommendation Engine](https://raw.githack.com/abhinav-profile/fun-with-ml-ai/main/recommendation.system.1.1.0.html) - An ML recommendation engine to suggest content similar to a user's
- [ML/Anomaly Detection](https://raw.githack.com/abhinav-profile/fun-with-ml-ai/main/anomaly.detection.1.1.0.html) - An anomaly detection ML model to flag potential financial or network data concerns
